### The paper has been accepted by The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and available at: [this link](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/publications/AlwazzanISBI2023.pdf).


All provided fusion models have been evaluted on the public dataset provided by, . We follwoed an identical 15-fold cross valdiation schem that is highligted in our work

This reposotory contains all implemneted fusion methods that can be transfered to any domain.

 * #### Available fusion models
    * MOAB fusion model
    * Outer Addition fusion model
    * Concatination fusion model  
    * Dual branch fusion model
    * Standard Addition fusion*. (please refer to the paper to get the astrik meaning)
