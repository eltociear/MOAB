### The paper has been accepted by The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and available at: [this link](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/publications/AlwazzanISBI2023.pdf).

All fusion models provided have been evaluated on the public dataset provided by,. We used the same 15-fold cross valdiation scheme that is highlighted in our paper. Any thing realted to the dataset can be found on the orignal work conducted by [Chen et al. Github page](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/PathomicFusion/tree/master/data/TCGA_GBMLGG). 

This repository provides all functional fusion methods that can be applied to any domain with any CNN 

 * #### Available fusion models
    * MOAB fusion model
    * Outer Addition fusion model
    * Concatination fusion model  
    * Dual branch fusion model
    * Standard Addition fusion*. (please refer to the paper to get the astrik meaning)
